      <h2>üìú About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Howdy! I'm Kyle, and I'm a software engineer based in the Sunnyvale, CA area. I'm a software engineer working at Deloitte doing SRE work at a popular social media company, and I specialize in backend web architecture and microservice development. I have experience with technology like Go, Python, and C++, as well as their related ecosystems. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I got my Bachelors of Science in Game Design Engineering in 2021 from the University of Silicon Valley, where I concentrated on computer graphics. Some highlights of my past experiences include working with Crown and NASA to build tools for engineers, building a startup that develops a platform for esports players to connect and network, and participating in many game jams. 
      </p>

      <p>
        When I'm not programming though, you can catch me weightlifting, hiking some of the nearby trails, or eating some great local food (especially pho). I enjoy video editing on the side when I can get around to it, and have a knack for martial arts and language learning (currently learning Spanish!).
