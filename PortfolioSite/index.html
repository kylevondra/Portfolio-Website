      <h2>ðŸ“œ About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Howdy! I'm Kyle, and for the last few years, I've been deep in the world of site reliability engineering, ensuring systems are not just up and running, but running optimally. My journey has been filled with plenty of experience involving popular platform technology, such as Kubernetes, Docker, AWS, Terraform, and Prometheus, Go, Linux, SQL, Ansible, and Python. I use all these tools to enhance system reliability and performance, build developer tools, and collaborate with key stakeholders and team members to better understand their development and deployment pipelines.  
      </p>

      <p>
        I got my Bachelors of Science in Game Design Engineering in 2021 from the University of Silicon Valley, where I concentrated on computer graphics. These days, I'm a Sr. Cloud Engineering Consultant at Deloitte, and I work with many different very high-profile clients. 
      </p>

      <p>
        When I'm not programming though, you can catch me weightlifting, blacksmithing at the forge, hiking some of the nearby trails, or eating some great local food (especially tacos). Some of my other hobbies include dancing, martial arts, tinkering with my homelab, and language learning (currently learning Spanish!).
